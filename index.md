## 1. As a Programmer
### 1.1. A brief one
Hello everyone, my name is **Xi Wang** and I go by **Sam**.
I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics with a pre-med track. 

### 1.2. Programming history
I am pretty decent programmer with the many CSE courses I have taken with knowledge about advance data structures.
I have made color shifting Mickey Mouse, a simple ganme of selecting the right picture corresponding to the text, and some cool sorting algorithms with C and C++. 
Though I have never developed any bigger software development projects on my own, **I would love to learnand try to develope one** (and more of course!). 

### 1.3. Favorite programming language
Bioinformaticians use R and Python for most (or even all) of their codes. As mentioned in the [README.md](README.md), I do personally favor Python over R as I learned and wrote in Python first. However, as for other languages, C, C++, or even Java would be out of my considerations most of the time simply because the added levels of complexity when using these codes. After, who would not prefer
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
over 
```
System.out,println("Hello, World!")
```

### 1.4. Expectation for the CSE110 course
Since this is an intro under the CSE110 course, I would like to state what I expect from the course. 
As a bioinformatics student, I am actually not required to take this course like other CSE majors do. *I am taking it based purely on interest*. I want to learn how to develope software, which I do believe could also help me significantly in the future bioinformatics field.


## 2. As a Person
### 2.1. Fun facts
1. I was born and grew up in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China.
2. Zhuhai and Macau are connected! We walk to Macau. 
3. Zhuhai is a city with comparably low population (just around 2M, which is actually pretty small in China).
4. However, Zhuhai is close to many major cities withint 2 hours of traveling, including Macau, Hongkong, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.
5. I went to high school in Cerritos, near the Long Beach area. 
6. I like UCSD, espcially the weather here.

### 2.2. What I like
I love cars, motorcycles, airplanes - everything motor related. While being a student would probably not afford me to buy any crazy cars, motorcycles, and airplanes (***of course***), I try to have fun with the limited cash I have in hands. 
I enjoy talking about and actually installing mods on my Mustang GT and Kawasaki Z900. I like to see how my personal babies ride the way I like them to. 
Assuming that I have time and energy left, I would go outdoor for some great sunshine of California. 

### 2.3. Scientific research
As a bioinformatics major, I am currently focusing on three different 
research topics:
- Mutational pattern signature assignment
- ACL reconstruction
- Knee tissue proteomics 

#### 2.3.1. Mutational pattern signature assignment
I am currently benchmarking and developing the tool [SigProfilerSingleSample](https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/SigProfilerSingleSample).

#### 2.3.2. ACL reconstruction
Under Dr. Robert L. Sah's supervision, my senior design team members and I are trying to figure out a better grafting techniques on ACL reconstruction using the rabbit model. However, this project is more about us learning the research and engineering design process than actually coming up with a state-of-the-art technique.
#### 2.3.3. Knee tissue proteomics
We are trying to quantify the proteins presented in human cartilage tissue with a concentration on various collagens. 


## 3. In conclusion
Once a wise man said:
> YOLO

I wish I could find my interests in software engineering that could possibly effect the rest of my life in this course. I am looking forward to code!
